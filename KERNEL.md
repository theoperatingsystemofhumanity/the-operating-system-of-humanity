## 1. Name & Symbol
The system is called **The Operating System of Humanity (OSOH)**. Its emblem is the **Necker Cube**, a simple geometric figure that shifts orientation depending on perception. This symbol embodies the essence of OSOH: perspective, transparency, simplicity, and coherence. Just as the cube reveals different realities depending on how one looks at it, OSOH reminds us that truth is filtered through perspective and that coherence comes from consciously choosing how we see and act.

## 2. Slogan
**One Coherent Future.**  
This phrase captures the purpose of OSOH: to align humanity’s diverse perspectives and actions toward a shared, flourishing future.

---

## 3. Purpose
The Operating System of Humanity exists to bring coherence to human behavior. Its ultimate goals are threefold: to face reality clearly, to reduce unnecessary suffering, and to maximize the flourishing of all conscious beings. By treating humanity as a system that can be tuned and upgraded, OSOH provides a framework for guiding both individual lives and collective structures toward greater alignment with truth, compassion, and sustainability.

## 4. Core Principles (The Three Protocols)
OSOH is grounded in three simple but powerful protocols:

**Transparency = Seeing.** We commit to facing reality clearly, valuing truth over illusion, and building our knowledge on the foundation of science, data, and openness.  

**Values = Wanting.** We orient our desires toward compassion and long-term flourishing. Instead of measuring success by narrow indicators like GDP, we recalibrate around a broader **Flourishing Index** that reflects the well-being of people, communities, and ecosystems.  

**Coherence = Acting.** We act together without coercion, using decentralized and adaptive methods of coordination. By healing divisions and building trust, we enable humanity to move as one body with many voices.

## 5. Common Enemies (Patterns of Harm)
OSOH does not identify enemies as people but as harmful patterns that emerge within individuals, groups, and systems. These patterns are like bugs in humanity’s operating code:  

- **Epistemic Corruption:** lies, propaganda, and noise that cloud truth.  
- **Ethical Corruption:** cruelty, greed, and indifference to suffering.  
- **Social Corruption:** division, oppression, and the erosion of trust.  
- **Systemic Corruption:** violence, authoritarianism, and environmental destruction.  

The task of OSOH is not to demonize, but to reveal and resolve these bugs through transparency, compassion, and coherent action.

## 6. Installation
Installing OSOH is an act of choice. It begins by deciding to believe in its principles, continues by living as if they are real, and comes to life through contributing—however small or large—to the coherence of humanity. Each person who installs OSOH becomes both a user and a co-creator.

---

## 7. Update Cycle
OSOH is not static software. It is open-source, forkable, and evolutionary. All protocols and principles are subject to review, iteration, and recalibration through collective intelligence. The values at its heart are never final; they must adapt as humanity grows in wisdom and understanding.  

---

## 8. Identity Protocol
To install OSOH is to shift identity. You are no longer merely a consumer of the future but a co-creator of it. Joining OSOH means recognizing yourself as part of a decentralized, global movement to align humanity with its highest potential.  

---

## 9. License
The Operating System of Humanity is **Open Source Humanity**. It is free to use, modify, and share. The only condition is that any changes must remain faithful to the prime directive: reducing suffering and increasing flourishing for all conscious beings.
